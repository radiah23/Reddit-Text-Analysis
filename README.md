Text Analysis of r/MyBoyfriendIsAI
Overview
This project analyzes 1,000 Reddit posts from the community r/MyBoyfriendIsAI, exploring sentiment trends and thematic patterns using PyTorch and various machine learning techniques.
Our goal was to understand public discourse around AI companionship, evaluate emotional tone, and investigate emerging themes using modern NLP tools.

Methods Used
K-Means Clustering using PyTorch tensors + CountVectorizer
Sentiment Analysis using NLTK’s SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
Deep Embedding Clustering (DEC) with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for latent space learning
Dimensionality Reduction Comparison:
PCA (noise reduction, speed optimization)
t-SNE (high-quality cluster visualization on smaller data)
UMAP (fast, well-suited for large datasets)
LDA Topic Modeling with gensim for thematic extraction

Project Context
This work was completed as part of the Data Infrastructure Group Lab, with the objective of gaining hands-on experience in:
PyTorch for text-based ML
Representation learning
Clustering algorithms
Real-world NLP applications
