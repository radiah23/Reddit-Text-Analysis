Text Analysis of r/MyBoyfriendIsAI
Overview : This project explores sentiment analysis and topic modeling on 1,000 Reddit posts from r/MyBoyfriendIsAI using PyTorch and various machine learning techniques.
Methods : 
K-Means Clustering with PyTorch tensors and CountVectorizer
NLTK Sentiment Analysis with SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
Deep Embedding Clustering with VAE for latent space representation
Dimensionality Reduction comparison (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP)
LDA Topic Modeling with Gensim for thematic analysis

This project was developed as part of our Data Infrastructure Group lab to familiarize ourselves with PyTorch and machine learning approaches to text analysis.
